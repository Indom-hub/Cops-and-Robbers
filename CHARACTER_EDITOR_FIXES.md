# Character Editor Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Safety Timeout Removed
- **Problem**: Safety timeout was closing the editor while players were actively editing
- **Solution**: Completely removed the 10-second auto-close timeout
- **Replacement**: Added Ctrl+F3 safety close keybind for emergency situations

### 2. ✅ Character Preview Improved
- **Problem**: Players couldn't see their character during editing
- **Solution**: Enhanced camera system with better positioning and lighting
- **Features Added**:
  - Improved camera positioning (face, body, full views)
  - Better lighting with `SetArtificialLightsState(true)`
  - Proper ped visibility settings
  - Camera switching with arrow keys:
    - **LEFT ARROW**: Face view
    - **RIGHT ARROW**: Body view  
    - **UP ARROW**: Full body view

### 3. ✅ Character Saving Fixed
- **Problem**: Players couldn't save edits to character slots
- **Solution**: Improved character data management and saving system
- **Improvements**:
  - Deep copy character data to prevent reference issues
  - Better error handling for invalid data
  - Proper slot-based saving with format `role_slot` (e.g., "cop_1", "robber_2")
  - Enhanced feedback messages

### 4. ✅ Lua 5.4 Compatibility
- **Problem**: Code used deprecated Lua 5.3 syntax
- **Solution**: Updated all code to Lua 5.4 standards
- **Changes Made**:
  - Replaced `pairs()` with `next` where appropriate
  - Updated string concatenation to use `string.format()`
  - Improved error handling with proper type checking

### 5. ✅ Enhanced Exit Mechanisms
- **Safety Close**: **Ctrl + F3** - Emergency exit
- **Normal Close**: **ESC** - Standard close
- **Emergency Exit**: **BACKSPACE** - Backup exit method
- **Commands**:
  - `/closechareditor` - Force close character editor
  - `/fixui` - Fix stuck UI/mouse cursor

## New Features Added

## Troubleshooting

3. Use `/fixui` command to force fix
4. Use `/closechareditor` as last resort

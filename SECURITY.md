## Security Recommendations

To help secure your server and player data:
- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly check for updates to FiveM, GTA V, and this game mode.
- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: For GitHub accounts and any other accounts that can access the server or repository.
- **Restrict Admin Access**: Limit the number of users with admin permissions within the game mode to reduce the risk of insider threats.

For additional guidance, refer to our [documentation](https://github.com/Indom-hub/Cops-and-Robbers/wiki) and [installation guide](https://github.com/Indom-hub/Cops-and-Robbers).
